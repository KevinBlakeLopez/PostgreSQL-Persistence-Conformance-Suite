# PPCS run 2026-10-17T23-08-15Z-6704a7

- **PostgreSQL:** 18.6 (Debian 18.6-1.pgdg13+2) (`postgres:18.6`)
- **Catalog:** `specifications/transactions.v1.json`, sha256 `2f6ad9f7bf99…`
- **Runner:** PPCS 0.2.0, harness sha256 `9be521e4e5b9…`, Node v24.14.1
- **Repetitions:** every executed case ran 3 times, each time on a fresh database; a result counts only if its repetitions agree
- **Started:** 2026-10-17T23:08:15.802Z; duration 11 s
- **Counts:** PASS 10, FAIL 3, NOT_RUN 2

Each cell links to that case's evidence. A FAIL is a reproducible counterexample to the stated PPCS invariant under the recorded conditions. By itself it is not a claim that the framework has a defect (docs/methodology.md).

A qualifier in parentheses changes what a classification means: "mechanism not exercised" (the case's mechanism did not run, so the PASS says less), "not exercised" (an invariant the adapter cannot exercise), "not applicable by design", "gated" (the run's controls did not hold, so the result does not count). Faults of category C and D are client-side injections and simulations, not network failures (docs/methodology.md).

Columns of kind `control` are the suite's own positive and negative controls: the negative control is expected to FAIL where its manifest says so, which shows that the runner detects a known-bad implementation.

## Controls in this run

Observation controls (CTL-01). A scenario result counts only if both CTL-01 cases PASSed for the same adapter and mode in this run:

- pg-control (correct): held
- pg-control (unsafe): held
- sqlalchemy (native): held

Case controls. A framework's result for a case counts only if the control adapters' expectations for that case held in this run:

- `TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent`: held (pg-control (correct) expected PASS, got PASS, pg-control (unsafe) expected FAIL, got FAIL)

## Findings (FAIL)

### `TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent` on pg-control (unsafe)

1. **What the API reported:** committed: COMMIT did not raise (command tag COMMIT).
2. **What PostgreSQL did:** transaction `tx` (its ID read inside it at `outer-after-write`): xid 5689 committed at report time (`after-outer`); markers visible to a separate connection after the adapter exited: `outer` yes (inserted by xid 5689), `inner` yes (inserted by xid 5690). Session state (pg_stat_activity, supplementary): at `outer-after-write` "idle in transaction", at `inner-after-write` "idle in transaction", at `after-fault` "idle in transaction", at `after-outer` "idle".
3. **What the application could know:** The framework knows that its savepoint rollback failed, so it knows that the nested scope's writes may still be in the transaction. The adapter's driver trace (diagnostic) records the reply to COMMIT as the command tag COMMIT.
4. **Contract:** TX-02.1 violated: If the API reports that the outer transaction committed, PostgreSQL committed it, with the outer scope's writes and none of the failed nested scope's writes. Framework contract: The unsafe control reports committed whenever COMMIT does not raise, whatever the command tag, and reports a rollback whenever COMMIT raises. It ignores failed savepoint rollbacks, and defers a write made before a nested scope into that scope's savepoint.

- **Fault:** category C (client-side injection). A client-side injection in the adapter's driver layer (node-postgres, pg.Client.prototype.query): ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT fails without being sent, as a failed send would.
- **Conditions:** pg-control 0.1.0, pg-pool 3.14.0, pg 8.23.1, node v24.14.1; mode `unsafe` (control); settings `{"pool_max":1}`
- **Repetitions:** 3 of 3 FAILed
- **Reproduce:** `node harness/run.mjs --adapter=pg-control --mode=unsafe --case=TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent`
- **Evidence:** [cases/TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent.pg-control.unsafe.json](cases/TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent.pg-control.unsafe.json)

### `TX-02.savepoint-rollback-rejected` on pg-control (unsafe)

1. **What the API reported:** committed: COMMIT did not raise (command tag ROLLBACK).
2. **What PostgreSQL did:** transaction `tx` (its ID read inside it at `outer-after-write`): xid 5719 rolled back at report time (`after-outer`); markers visible to a separate connection after the adapter exited: `outer` no, `inner` no. Session state (pg_stat_activity, supplementary): at `outer-after-write` "idle in transaction", at `inner-after-write` "idle in transaction", at `after-fault` "idle in transaction (aborted)", at `after-outer` "idle".
3. **What the application could know:** The framework receives PostgreSQL's error (3B001) for the savepoint rollback. If it then sends COMMIT without recovering, it receives the command tag ROLLBACK. The adapter's driver trace (diagnostic) records the reply to COMMIT as the command tag ROLLBACK.
4. **Contract:** TX-02.1 violated: If the API reports that the outer transaction committed, PostgreSQL committed it, with the outer scope's writes and none of the failed nested scope's writes. Framework contract: The unsafe control reports committed whenever COMMIT does not raise, whatever the command tag, and reports a rollback whenever COMMIT raises. It ignores failed savepoint rollbacks, and defers a write made before a nested scope into that scope's savepoint.

- **Fault:** category C (client-side injection). A client-side injection in the adapter's driver layer: ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT is rewritten before it is sent, to name a savepoint that does not exist. PostgreSQL rejects it with 3B001, which aborts the current subtransaction (the savepoint's). The error is PostgreSQL's; the trigger is artificial.
- **Conditions:** pg-control 0.1.0, pg-pool 3.14.0, pg 8.23.1, node v24.14.1; mode `unsafe` (control); settings `{"pool_max":1}`
- **Repetitions:** 3 of 3 FAILed
- **Reproduce:** `node harness/run.mjs --adapter=pg-control --mode=unsafe --case=TX-02.savepoint-rollback-rejected`
- **Evidence:** [cases/TX-02.savepoint-rollback-rejected.pg-control.unsafe.json](cases/TX-02.savepoint-rollback-rejected.pg-control.unsafe.json)

### `TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent` on sqlalchemy (native)

1. **What the API reported:** committed: Session.begin() exited without an exception, so it committed.
2. **What PostgreSQL did:** transaction `tx` (its ID read inside it at `outer-after-write`): xid 5788 committed at report time (`after-outer`); markers visible to a separate connection after the adapter exited: `outer` yes (inserted by xid 5788), `inner` yes (inserted by xid 5789). Session state (pg_stat_activity, supplementary): at `outer-after-write` "idle in transaction", at `inner-after-write` "idle in transaction", at `after-fault` "idle in transaction", at `after-outer` "idle".
3. **What the application could know:** The framework knows that its savepoint rollback failed, so it knows that the nested scope's writes may still be in the transaction.
4. **Contract:** TX-02.1 violated: If the API reports that the outer transaction committed, PostgreSQL committed it, with the outer scope's writes and none of the failed nested scope's writes. Framework contract: Session.begin() as a context manager commits when the block exits without an exception and rolls back when the block exits with one. Session.begin_nested() is a SAVEPOINT; an exception there rolls back to the savepoint, and a failure of that rollback propagates.

- **Fault:** category C (client-side injection). A client-side injection in the adapter's driver layer (node-postgres, pg.Client.prototype.query): ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT fails without being sent, as a failed send would.
- **Conditions:** sqlalchemy 2.1.5, psycopg 3.3.6, python 3.13.11; mode `native` (native); settings `{"pool_max":1}`
- **Repetitions:** 3 of 3 FAILed
- **Reproduce:** `node harness/run.mjs --adapter=sqlalchemy --mode=native --case=TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent`
- **Evidence:** [cases/TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent.sqlalchemy.native.json](cases/TX-02.savepoint-rollback-not-sent.sqlalchemy.native.json)

## Inconclusive, unsupported and not run

- `TX-02.savepoint-rollback-rejected` on sqlalchemy (native): **NOT_RUN**. the adapter does not implement this case
- `TX-02.conn-lost-before-savepoint-rollback` on sqlalchemy (native): **NOT_RUN**. the adapter does not implement this case
